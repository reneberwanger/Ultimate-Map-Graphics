# Update V2

In this update, we have made the following improvements:

- **Changed Font:** The in-game font has been updated to a more visually appealing style.
- **Removed Annoying White Borders:** The white borders around map fonts have been removed for a cleaner look.

We would love to hear from the community if there's interest in a separate font package or perhaps bringing the old font back.
